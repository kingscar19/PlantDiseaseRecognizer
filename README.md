ðŸŒ± Plant Disease Recognizer
A Deep Learning-Powered Image Analyzer to Identify Plant Diseases from Leaf Images.
ðŸš€ Overview
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze images of plant leaves and detect potential diseases. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model provides fast and accurate predictions to help farmers and researchers monitor plant health effectively.

ðŸ›  Features
Disease Detection: Identify a variety of plant diseases from leaf images.
User-Friendly Interface: A Streamlit-based app for seamless interaction.
High Accuracy: Built using state-of-the-art deep learning models like ResNet, VGG, or custom CNN architectures.
Expandable: Easily add support for more plant species and diseases by retraining the model.

ðŸŽ¯ How It Works
Input: Upload a leaf image.
Processing: The image is preprocessed and fed into the trained CNN model.
Output: The app displays the predicted disease (if any) and confidence score.
